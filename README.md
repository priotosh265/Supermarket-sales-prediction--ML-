Supermarket-sales-prediction using Machine Learning 

Sales Dashboard Project: Predicting Supermarket Sales

Objective: Utilize machine learning to predict supermarket sales based on various factors.

Key Features:
Interactive Sales Dashboard using Streamlit.

Utilized machine learning models: Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
Evaluated models based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

Results:
Linear Regression: MSE = 1.4677546002542146e-26, R-squared = 1.0.
K-Nearest Neighbors: MSE = Your MSE Value, R-squared = Your R-squared Value.
Decision Tree: MSE = [Your MSE Value], R-squared = Your R-squared Value.
Random Forest: MSE = [Your MSE Value], R-squared = [Your R-squared Value].

Conclusion:
The best model for sales prediction is [Best Model Name] due to its lowest MSE and highest R-squared.

Next Steps:
Refinement of models for improved accuracy.
Integration of additional features for better predictions.
